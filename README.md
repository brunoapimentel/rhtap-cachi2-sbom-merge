# Merging Cachi2 reported components into RHTAP SBOMs

## Sample Repositories

- [Build Service](https://github.com/redhat-appstudio/build-service/commit/d1a9e858489d1515621398fb02942da068f1c956)

## How the SBOMs were generated?

- Cachi2: Clone the repository, checkout to specific commit, process it with Cachi2
- RHTAP: Import the repository in RHTAP, set the specific commit, build it and fetch the resulting SBOM
- Merged: Generated by merging both SBOMs (Cachi2 and RHTAP) with the merge.py script
