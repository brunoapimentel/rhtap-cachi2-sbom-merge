# Merging Cachi2 reported components into RHTAP SBOMs

The goal of this case study is to find out the differences in the way that Syft and Cachi2 report
the same components, so that proper deduplication can be done.

Check the contents of the [find-duplicates](./find-duplicates.ipynb) script to see an analysis of each 
sample repository present in this study. 

## How the SBOMs were generated?

- Cachi2: Clone the repository, checkout to specific commit, process it with Cachi2
- RHTAP: Import the repository in RHTAP, set the specific commit, build it and fetch the resulting SBOM
- Merged: Generated by merging both SBOMs (Cachi2 and RHTAP) with the cachi2/utils/merge_syft_sbom.py script
